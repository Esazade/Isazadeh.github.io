# C# Fundamentals

In this section, you’ll learn the **fundamental building blocks of C#** —  
the core concepts that every C# developer should know before diving into advanced topics.  

We’ll cover everything from variables, data types, and operators,  
to control flow, loops, and exception handling.  

If you’re new to C#, this is the perfect place to start.  
If you’re already familiar, it’s a great refresher to strengthen your foundations.
