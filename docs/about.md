# About Me

I’m a **software engineer** with around **7 years of experience**, mostly focused on **backend development**.  
Throughout my career, I’ve worked with **C#**, **PHP (Laravel)**, and **Node.js** —  
and on the frontend side, I’ve built projects using **React** and **Next.js**.

Here, I share the programming concepts that once felt confusing to me —  
explained in a simple and practical way.  
My goal is to make these notes helpful both for myself  
and for anyone who enjoys digging deeper into how things actually work.

Sometimes I skip the very basic topics that are already covered everywhere,  
and instead focus on areas that made me stop, think, and experiment.  
(Though, fair warning — a few posts might still sound “basic” depending on your experience 😉)
