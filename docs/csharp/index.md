# C# 

In this section, I share my personal notes and thoughts from revisiting C#.  
Many of these ideas come from **Pluralsight courses** and real-world programming experience.  

My goal isn’t to rewrite what’s already explained everywhere —  
but to explore the parts of C# that once confused me,  
and to explain them in a **clear and practical** way.

Each topic here aims to give a slightly different perspective,  
so even if you already know the concept,  
you might still find a new way of looking at it.
