# C# Fundamentals

In this section, I share my personal notes and thoughts from revisiting C#.  
Many of these ideas come from **Pluralsight courses** and real-world programming experience.  

My goal isnâ€™t to rewrite whatâ€™s already explained everywhere â€”  
but to explore the parts of C# that once confused me,  
and to explain them in a **clear and practical** way.

Each topic here aims to give a slightly different perspective,  
so even if you already know the concept,  
you might still find a new way of looking at it.
